origins "remake" in spigot

nothing really to say about it

made by agmas

feel free to add your own """pp"""s (not the male genital, it stands for "power pack") by adding your pp's name to the "pps" list (created on the "onEnable" func) and in the "MyTask" function, find the code for book setup and make your book. Finally, you can code the plugin like any other. Note: use "hasPP(String pp, Player p)" to check if a player has a PP (No, this will not check if you have a dick.)

Will I organize my code? no
